# Marks to Grade Calculator in Dart

This Dart program calculates a grade based on marks entered by the user. It validates user input to ensure only numbers between 0 and 100 are accepted and assigns a grade based on predefined criteria.

## How it Works

1. The user is prompted to enter marks (between 0 and 100).
2. Input is validated to ensure:
   - It is a valid integer.
   - The number falls within the range of 0 to 100.
3. Based on the input marks, a grade is calculated using the following criteria:
   - **90 and above**: A+++
   - **80 - 89**: A+
   - **70 - 79**: A
   - **60 - 69**: B
   - **50 - 59**: C
   - **40 - 49**: D
   - **Below 40**: F
4. The calculated grade is displayed to the user.
